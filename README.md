# Neural-Delay-Project
Simulation code, analysis scripts, and figures for a minimal in-silico study of synaptic delay under modest physiological perturbations. Models single-synapse latency with temperature (Q10 scaling) and pH (probability, variability), with 5,000 trials per condition reporting mean, variance, and reliability.
